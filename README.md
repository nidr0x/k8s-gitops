# nidr0x Homelab üè°

Welcome to the nidr0x Homelab repository! Here you'll find [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) manifests and [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) definitions for a homelab environment, all running on top of [Talos](https://talos.dev). This setup includes a wide range of applications, each organized into its own folder, with versioning expertly managed by [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/).
