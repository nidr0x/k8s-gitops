# üè° nidr0x Homelab

Welcome to the nidr0x Homelab repository! Here you'll find [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) manifests and [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) definitions for a homelab environment, all running on top of [Talos](https://talos.dev) and [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/).

## üîó External cloud dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

| Service                                   | Use                                                       | Cost                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) | Domain & R2 (Terrafom backend) & Oauth (Using Zero Trust) | ~$10/yr              |
| [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)         | Repository                                                | Free                 |
| [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)           | SMTP email platform                                       | Free (up to 300/day) |

## üìÅ Repository structure

The repository is organized into folders by application. Each folder contains the necessary manifest files to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster. The `argocd` folder contains files for setting up and managing ArgoCD.
